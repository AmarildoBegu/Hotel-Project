# Hotel-Project. In this project we are doing some SQL work to better understand the dataset and to build some quick tables that we can use, but because the dataset it's not too complicated i included the entire table and did not create different tables to form relationships. But the SQL code will help us to understand and if you want you can try by creating the tables from that SQL code. And assign keys to the columns. We are trying to find aswears to questions like "Is our hotel revenue growing each year?", "Should we increase our parking lot size?" and "What trends can we see in the data?". But you can use the dataset for many more questions that you think will help the hotel management to increase their Sales and Revenues. And then we are going to use Power BI to make the vizualizations. I am sorry that my Power BI is not posted but here is a snap picture of the finished dashboard.<img width="746" alt="Hotel Project" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93358935/166809594-6df37a43-14d5-4349-a6c7-51387e3ae12d.png">. Thank You!
