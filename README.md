# Hotel-Project. In this project we are doing some SQL work to better understand the dataset and to build some quick tables that we can use, but because the dataset it's not too complicated i included the entire table and did not create different tables to form relationships. But the SQL code will help us to understand and if you want you can try by creating the tables from that SQL code. And assign keys to the columns. And then we are going to use Power BI to make the vizualizations. I am sorry that my Power BI is not posted but here is a snap picture of the finished dashboard. <img width="960" alt="Hotel Project" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93358935/166809330-de41154f-0ca8-4aca-a8ba-ad2f723d67c9.png">.
